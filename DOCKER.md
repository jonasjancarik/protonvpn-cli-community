# Docker Setup for ProtonVPN CLI

This document provides instructions on how to use the Docker setup for the ProtonVPN CLI application.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Production Setup

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your ProtonVPN credentials:

```bash
PROTONVPN_USERNAME=your_username
PROTONVPN_PASSWORD=your_password
OPENVPN_USERNAME=your_openvpn_username  # get it from https://account.protonvpn.com/account-password#openvpn
OPENVPN_PASSWORD=your_openvpn_password
PROTONVPN_TIER=1  # Optional: Your ProtonVPN tier (1=Free, 2=Basic, 3=Plus/Visionary (default: 1))
PROTONVPN_PROTOCOL=udp  # Optional: Connection protocol (UDP or TCP, defaults to UDP)
```

### Building and Starting the Container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will build the Docker image and start a container in detached mode.

### Running ProtonVPN Commands

Since the ProtonVPN CLI requires root privileges, you'll need to execute commands inside the running container:

```bash
# Connect to the container
docker exec -it protonvpn-cli bash

# Inside the container, you can run ProtonVPN commands
protonvpn --help
protonvpn connect  # Connect to ProtonVPN
protonvpn status  # Check connection status
protonvpn disconnect  # Disconnect from ProtonVPN
protonvpn init  # Initialize ProtonVPN - this is done automatically on startup
```

### Using as a Service Provider

The Docker setup is designed to allow other containers to use the VPN connection. This is achieved through Docker's network mode feature. The example service in the docker compose.yml demonstrates this:

```yaml
example-service:
  image: alpine:latest
  network_mode: "service:protonvpn-cli"
  # ... other configuration
```

Any container that needs to use the VPN connection should:
1. Set `network_mode: "service:protonvpn-cli"`
2. Depend on the protonvpn-cli service using `depends_on`

## Development Setup

This project includes a development container configuration for VS Code or other compatible editors.

### Using VS Code Dev Containers

1. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in VS Code.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Click on the green icon in the bottom-left corner of VS Code and select "Reopen in Container".
4. VS Code will build and start the development container, and you'll be able to develop inside it.

### Development Container Features

- The development container mounts the project directory, allowing you to edit files directly from your host machine.
- It includes all necessary dependencies for development and debugging.
- The container runs with root privileges, which are required for the ProtonVPN CLI.
- Python packages are installed in development mode (`pip install -e .`).

### Running Commands in the Development Container

You can run commands directly in the VS Code terminal, which will be connected to the development container:

```bash
protonvpn --help
```

## Configuration Persistence

Both the production and development setups include a volume for persistent storage of ProtonVPN configuration:

```yaml
volumes:
  - protonvpn-config:/root/.pvpn-cli
```

This ensures that your ProtonVPN configuration is preserved even if the container is restarted or rebuilt.

## Security Considerations

The container runs with elevated privileges (`privileged: true`) and has additional capabilities (`NET_ADMIN`, `SYS_MODULE`) to allow VPN functionality. This is necessary for the VPN to work correctly, but it means the container has more access to the host system than a typical Docker container.

Additional security features:
- Kill switch can be enabled by setting `VPN_ENABLE_KILLSWITCH=true` in the environment
- The VPN connection is isolated in its own network
- Credentials are managed through environment variables

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the VPN connection, ensure that:

1. The container has access to the internet
2. The `/dev/net/tun` device is properly mounted
3. The container has the necessary privileges and capabilities
4. Your ProtonVPN credentials are correctly set in the `.env` file

You can check the logs with:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

## Stopping the Container

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove the persistent volume as well:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
